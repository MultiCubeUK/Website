Dear Cubers,<span class="rm" onclick="expandNews2()">Read More</span><br/><br/>

Just to make you all aware, we have taken the decision to close Crainer, in favour of a more popular pack.<br/><br/>

Crainer was a very unstable, high-maintenance pack that put a large strain on our hardware, and rarely has more than 2 players on it.
 We are looking into other packs to replace this, the current <span id="hide2">favourite being FTB Infinity Evolved (Normal, not expert).<br/><br/>

We'll keep you updated!<br/><br/>

Thank you for your understanding!</span>
