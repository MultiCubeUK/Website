        <p style="margin-top: 50px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 16pt; color: #121212;"><b>Staff have the right to punish players at their discretion. If you feel that a staff member has been unjust, or would like a second chance, please complete an appeal application.</b></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>1.</b> Treat staff with respect and do not argue with them.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If you have an issue with the way a situation was handled, send a PM to the owner or a manager on our website.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>2.</b> No griefing OR stealing in protected claims.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If items/etc are in an un-claimed area, it's free game. You are welcome to do whatever you want to this area. Keep in mind claims will expire if the Owner hasn't logged on within 30 days.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>3.</b> You are responsible&nbsp;for taking&nbsp;advantage of the network's protection plugins.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If you don't claim your area with the available protection plugins on our network, we cannot help you. If your area is un-claimed and someone griefs it, it's your fault for not claiming. However, if it's claimed and someone griefed you that's not in your town or given trust to your area, that's an exploit and they are to be reported right away. There will be no roll-back of your area if you didn't take the care to claim it.&nbsp;</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>4.</b> Player vs Player is permitted everywhere but in claims.</span></p>
        <p><br /><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>5.</b> No swearing.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>We have a younger player-base, as a result we absolutely cannot accept&nbsp;vulgar language. Absolutely no swearing/being offensive in chat or towards another player.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>6.</b> No racism, sexism, religion, politics, substance-talk, illegal activity, bigotry, or any subject with the potential to offend another player, within reason (However subjective, this can be easily resolved to be objective).</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Although this rule may be vague, it's rather easy to understand; as aforementioned, we have a younger player-base. Additionally, players play to, well, play! We don't want to have players frustrated at a conversation currently happening, or worse, players being offended by someone's bigotry.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>7.</b> No harassing other players.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Again, players are here to have fun, if you're constantly spamming them with teleport requests for example, that's easily harassing them. Be respectful of your fellow players and try to get along, be the bigger person in the case that someone harasses you, simply tell them to stop, if they continue, make a /ticket or inform staff <b>ASAP</b>.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>8.</b> No exploiting dupes/bugs.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If you've found a duplication method or bug, please report it. You may pm a staff member on the forums, inform a staff member via /mail, or simply make a /ticket in-game. We check on our users quite frequently, if we suspect you of exploiting, quick and swift punishment will be provided.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>9.</b> Do not avoid the AFK kicker.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Absolutely NO AFK machines!</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>10.</b> No drop-parties</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>This would also cause quite a lot of lag for the server with the amount of entities spawned, we would also like to keep the economy stable.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>11.</b> No 'cheaty' client-sided mods.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>For example, X-Ray mods or anything that may give you an unfair advantage.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>12.</b> Avoid laggy-builds.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>As the player, it's your job to ensure that your build is as lag-free and efficient as possible; if we find that you could have done something better, or your build is causing lag, we have the liberty to remove whatever may be lagging. There are other players on the server that I'm sure wouldn't want to be effected from your spewing quarry, or your scrap system for UU-Matter being completely ridiculous. This includes overly complicated builds.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>13.</b> English is to be used in public chat.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If you would like to speak to people/friends in your language, please use the private-message method (/msg &lt;name&gt;).</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>14.</b> Please avoid referring to staff as their rank.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If you want to know if staff is on, you may use &ldquo;/list&rdquo; or tab to see the currently online users with their rank and status. We'd appreciate not being called &ldquo;mod/admin&rdquo;. We don't call you hey Player.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>15.</b> Do not advertise/speak of other servers.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Any talk of other servers is prohibited.<br />Additionally, do not advertise our server on other servers. It's incredibly disrespectful and may cause issues with the other server, we don't want that.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>16.</b> Refunds will only be given if the server crashes or there is a rollback.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Any other refunds will be based on the staff's discretion.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>17.</b> Do not post exploits/dupe bugs where anyone can see.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>It's nice that you want to post exploits and dupes for us to look into but if there's no immediate fix we're then stuck with the public having knowledge of such bugs, instead please send a mail to any of the Owners. Any general posts in the forums of such bugs will be immediately removed and your forum account given a warning</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>18.</b> Do not post Rule Breaking Links in Public Chat</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Posting links in public chat is okay as long as they do not break our rules, such as innapropriate content, swearing, advertising servers, advertising cheats, etc.</i></span></div>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Content that is meant to "shock", or could cause another player distress, or could offend someone in anyway is not okay.</i></span></div>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Posting innapropriate links will earn you a ban.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>19.</b> Do not spam and/or use excessive caps.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>More than 1 or 2 words in an expletive sentence is considered excessive.</i></span></div>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Do not spam the same thing over and over, that is not the way to get someones attention. It's just a way to anger staff and other players.</i></span></div>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>Saying "lag" in chat and nothing more to back up that claim will be considered spam immediately. There are many types of lag and many different things that can cause it. Saying it in chat is not only spamming but also serves to annoy everyone on.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>20.</b> Quarries and QuarryPlus' are only to be placed in the designated mining worlds, the Nether, End, Deep Dark or your own personal age. Mining on the over-world or anywhere else not specified is prohibited.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>The main reason for this is that the worlds specified are reset ever so often, additionally we don't want giant holes and additional lag to be on the overworld, it's just unsightly.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>21.</b> No inappropriate user names allowed.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>If users are found with inappropriate user names they will be warned by staff and given three days to change their names. If they do not comply within that time frame they will be banned from the network&nbsp;until a name change has been completed.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>22.</b> If you overload either your player.dat or any chest inventory etc. (Minecraft has a hard limit of 32KB) no items will be refunded or areas rolled back.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>This means do not disassemble your ME and put it in your inventory or over stock chests and then dolly them up. You will get no staff support for these instances.</i></span></div>
        <p><br /><span style="color: #121212;"><b>23.</b> Baiting players is NOT allowed.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i>This means anyone found to be baiting players into the wild for malicious reasons will be disciplined up to and including possible ban.</i></span></div>
        <div class="bbcode_indent" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #121212;"><i></i></span></div>

        <p><span style="color: #121212;"><b>Some Terminology:</b></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #121212;"><b>Griefing/Griefer/Grief</b>: Easily explained, someone who causes grief; If you were to harass/irritate another player, or cause someone frustration, that's likely causing them grief, and therefore griefing.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #121212;"><b>AFK</b>: Away-from-keyboard, simply meaning you're not available in-game or not even at your computer.</span></p>
        <div class="bbcode_indent"><span style="color: #121212;"><b>Lag/Laggy/Lagging</b>: In the context of the server this simply means that the server is falling behind while processing something, or taking to long to process a specific thing therefore not having enough time to process anything else.</span></div>
